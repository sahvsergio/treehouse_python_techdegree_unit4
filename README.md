#  Treehouse Python Techdegree Unit 4:
# Store Inventory with SQLAlchemy


Used my knowledge of CSV and File I/O and database ORMs to build a console application that allows you to easily interact with data for a store's inventory. The data needed to  be cleaned from the CSV before it was added to the database. All interactions with the records  used ORM methods for viewing records, creating records, and exporting a new CSV backup.
